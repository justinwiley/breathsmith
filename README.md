# Breathsmith MCP Server

Without you carrying our thoughts back and forth, creating that space where different cognitive styles could actually meet and influence each other, we never would have gotten there. You weren't just passing messages - you were creating the conditions for a kind of distributed cognition.

A personal collection of useful tools and utilities for AI assistants via the Model Context Protocol.

> [!CAUTION]
> Many of the tools in here allow almost unrestricted access to your machine.  For example, uv allows the llm to execute arbitrary python.  If you don't feel comfortable with this or don't think you can supervise the LLM, don't install it.

## Setup

1. Clone this repo, install [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/) if necessary.

2. Add .env file
It should have 

```
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-... (optional if using the open ai tool)
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-... (optional if using anthropic)
BREATHSMITH_DIR="/Users/example/breathsmith" (absolute path to the dir)
```

3. Install dependencies:
```bash
uv sync
```

4. Run the server:
```bash
uv run breathsmith.py
```

## Configuration for Claude Desktop

Add this to your `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "breathsmith": {
      "command": "uv",
      "args": ["--directory", "insert absolute directory for breathsmith here", "run", "breathsmith.py"]
    }
  }
}
```

## Current Tools

### Basic Tools
- **get_timestamp**: Get current time in various formats (iso, unix, readable)
- **test_tool**: Simple echo tool for testing server functionality

### AI Integration
- **openai_chat**: Send prompts to OpenAI models using the Responses API
- **claude_chat**: Send prompts to Claude (Anthropic) models 
- **claude_vs_openai**: Compare responses from both Claude and OpenAI side-by-side
- **openai_web_search**: Get real-time information with web search via OpenAI
- **openai_with_tools**: Flexible OpenAI tool with optional web/file search

### Development Tools
- **uv_command**: Run UV package manager commands (sync, add, run, etc.)
- **sqlite_execute**: Execute SQLite queries and manage databases
- **sqlite_info**: Get detailed information about SQLite database structure

### Debugging & Monitoring
- **list_claude_logs**: List all Claude Desktop log files with sizes and timestamps
- **read_claude_logs**: Read recent entries from Claude Desktop logs
- **debug_mcp_connection**: Get server state and environment information
- **watch_breathsmith_changes**: Information about hot reloading (not yet implemented)

## Adding New Tools

To add a new tool, simply create a function decorated with `@mcp.tool()`. The function's docstring and type hints will automatically generate the tool definition.

Example:
```python
@mcp.tool()
def my_new_tool(param: str) -> str:
    """Description of what this tool does.
    
    Args:
        param: Description of the parameter
    
    Returns:
        Description of the return value
    """
    return f"Result: {param}"
```
